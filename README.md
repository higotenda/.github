# HiGoTenDaScience[^1]
We are an aspiring group of developers based in Bengaluru, trying to build solutions and projects pertaining to anything that catches our eye, from low-level systems or Machine Learning.

[^1]: The name _HiGoTenDa_ was chosen to commemorate and remember the first babbles of a transformer trained by @lalith-AE30. The name _HiGoTenDa_ is __completely unrelated to__ and bears no reference to the Japanese Gotemba City Festival, or similarly to any obscure German or Italian vocabulary or mis-spellings thereof and the like. Any similarities with historical names, characters or entities precluding the aforementioned should be presumed as intentional and reported so that this footnote may be expanded.
